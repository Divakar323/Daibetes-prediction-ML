# CONCLUSION
At last we have reached our results of predicting diabetes by applying machine learning algorithms widely. The entire procedure was based on machine learning workflow. We have completed a classification model task with proper practical knowledge to deal with. We have undergone through many steps such as data exploration, data cleaning steps, feature of engineering basics and advanced model feature selections, model selection parameters and hyper parameter tuning using Scikit Learn library from jupyter notebook.There is a strong possibility that running the project with logistic regression would give much better results.
